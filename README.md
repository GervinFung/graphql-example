# A minimal example for me setup graphql with typescript

This repo was made for me to gain a better understanding on setting up a React-Express-GraphQL

More importantly it allows me to use `graphql-codegen` tools to generate type definitions for me, so I dont have to maintain 2 source of types

No fancy UI, just simple stuff to prove that this project works and the setup was done properly
